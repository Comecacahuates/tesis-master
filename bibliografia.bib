    abstract = {Certain data-communication protocols hog the spotlight, but all of them have a lot in common. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet explains the engineering problems that are inherent in communicating digital information from point to point. The top-down approach mentioned in the subtitle means that the book starts at the top of the protocol stack--at the application layer--and works its way down through the other layers, until it reaches bare wire. The authors, for the most part, shun the well-known seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack in favor of their own five-layer (application, transport, network, link, and physical) model. It's an effective approach that helps clear away some of the hand waving traditionally associated with the more obtuse layers in the OSI model. The approach is definitely theoretical--don't look here for instructions on configuring Windows 2000 or a Cisco router--but it's relevant to reality, and should help anyone who needs to understand networking as a programmer, system architect, or even administration guru.The treatment of the network layer, at which routing takes place, is typical of the overall style. In discussing routing, authors James Kurose and Keith Ross explain (by way of lots of clear, definition-packed text) what routing protocols need to do: find the best route to a destination. Then they present the mathematics that determine the best path, show some code that implements those algorithms, and illustrate the logic by using excellent conceptual diagrams. Real-life implementations of the algorithms--including Internet Protocol (both IPv4 and IPv6) and several popular IP routing protocols--help you to make the transition from pure theory to networking technologies. --David WallTopics covered: The theory behind data networks, with thorough discussion of the problems that are posed at each level (the application layer gets plenty of attention). For each layer, there's academic coverage of networking problems and solutions, followed by discussion of real technologies. Special sections deal with network security and transmission of digital multimedia. },

Although resource allocations on the commoncontrol channel (CCH) reserved for safety-related applications have been well investigated, efficient usage of the other SCHs is less developed. With new ITS safety-related applications appearing, such as autonomous driving or truck platooning, as well as the expected coexistence between ITS and non-ITS technologies for smart mobility applications, operating on multiple channels and efficiently sharing the ITS spectrum become critical. First, multi-channel operations aim at mitigating the communication load on specific channels by offloading part of traffic to alternate channels. Second, multi-channel operations aim at providing mechanisms to dynamically change channels and fit to the service requirements as function of external interferences or to varying traffic conditions. In this chapter, we describe the regulations and mechanisms for ITS multi-channel operation and coexistence in the US and in the EU. We first provide an overview of the frequency allocations and access restrictions for ITS, and then describe the protocols available in standards and R{\&}D for multi-channel operations.},

The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical presentation$\backslash$nand management of recent iatrogenic perforations during therapeutic$\backslash$ncolonoscopy. METHODS: Consecutive patients referred to four academic$\backslash$ncancer centers in Japan were retrospectively reviewed using each$\backslash$ncenter's endoscopy database of medical records. Data was obtained$\backslash$nby means of an extensive data collection sheet. Since we evaluated$\backslash$nthe data including iatrogenic perforation during newly developed$\backslash$ntherapeutic procedure such as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)$\backslash$nor hemoclips, the collection of patient data was set from the period$\backslash$nof the beginning of ESD technique in each hospital in this study.$\backslash$nRESULTS: The overall rate of occurrence of perforation was 0.15$\backslash${\%}$\backslash$n(23/15, 160). Perforation rate for EMR (0.58$\backslash${\%}) showed a significantly$\backslash$nhigher rate (P {\textless} 0.0001) than that for hot biopsy and polypectomy.$\backslash$nThe rate for ESD (14$\backslash${\%}) showed a markedly higher rate (P {\textless} 0.0001)$\backslash$nthan that for other standard procedures. Of those perforations, endoscopic$\backslash$nclipping was performed in 56.5$\backslash${\%} of the patients, and conservative$\backslash$ntreatment was successful in 100$\backslash${\%} of the patients with successful$\backslash$nclosure. Both CT scan findings and serology results (WBC, CRP) after$\backslash$nperforation were poor predictors for need for surgery as opposed$\backslash$nto conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Further improvements in$\backslash$nEMR with special knife techniques are required to simply and safely$\backslash$nremove large colorectal neoplasms, because perforation rate for ESD$\backslash$nshows a markedly higher. Conservative management may be possible$\backslash$nin patients who have undergone complete endoscopic clipping.},

@article{Mezher2017,
	abstract = {One of the most important goals of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in smart cities is the efficient management of accidents, specially to prevent them. Our research lies on a promising smart service, which soon might be available in our cities. After the occurrence of an accident, a vehicle could make a light and short video of the situation and send it through the VANET till reaching an access point in the infrastructure of the city to alert the emergencies service (e.g., 911 or 112). With a video message, the level of seriousness of the accident could be better interpreted by the authorities (i.e., health care unit, police, ambulance drivers) than with a simple text message. In this way, vehicles could participate in reporting a situation in the city using the ad hoc network so it would be possible to have a quick reaction of the emergency units and even prevent further accidents. The deployment of an efficient routing protocol to manage video-reporting messages in VANETs has important benefits by enabling a fast warning of the incident, which potentially might save lives. To contribute with this goal, we propose a multimedia multimetric map-aware routing protocol to provide video-reporting messages over VANETs in smart cities. Furthermore, a realistic scenario is created by using real maps with SUMO including buildings that may interfere the signal between sender and receiver. Also, we use our REVsim tool that allows vehicles to avoid choosing vehicles behind buildings to be chosen as next forwarding nodes. Simulations show the benefits of our proposal, taking into account the mobility of the nodes and the presence of interfering buildings.},

Especially the importance of autonomic, self-configuration capabilities becomes particularly significant. The IPv6-based mobile ad hoc networks are envisioned to be a good candidate technology for the IoT networks. However, they lack efficient address auto-configuration mechanisms, which could extend the IPv6 to cover the requirements of such a demanding networking environment. To address this challenge, we have proposed the Neighbor Discovery ++ (ND++) solution for the enhanced stateless address auto-configuration. The ND++ incorporates a well-performing flooding control mechanism to the basic IPv6 ND design, which results in a very low protocol overhead in the order of few messages per node. The presented simulation-based evaluation, performed under diversified mobile scenarios, confirms the scalability and robustness of this approach with regard to the key identified metrics - reliability, overhead, and latency.},

	abstract = {A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a multi-hop wireless network capable of autonomous operation. The mobility of MANET nodes can lead to frequent and unpredictable topology changes. Most MANET literature assumes that network related information of a node (such as its IP address, netmask, etc.) is configured statically, prior to the node joining the MANET. However, not all nodes have IP addresses permanently assigned to them. Such nodes rely on a centralized server and use a dynamic host configuration protocol, like DHCP [1], to acquire an IP address. Such a solution cannot be employed in MANETs due to the unavailability of any centralized DHCP server. In this paper, we first present a survey of possible solutions approaches, and discuss their limitations. Then, we present a distributed dynamic host configuration protocol designed to configure nodes in a MANET. We show that the proposed protocol works correctly and does not have the limitations of earlier approaches. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the solution through simulation experiments, and conclude with a discussion of related security issues.},

	abstract = {Every node must configure its network interface with a unique address in order to communicate with other nodes. If a centralized DHCP server exists, it would easily and automatically provide addresses to nodes in a network. However, in a mobile ad hoc network, difficulties exist in supporting address autoconfiguration due to the lack of centralized servers. Therefore, we propose a distributed address autoconfiguration approach for a mobile ad hoc network using address reservation and optimistic duplicated address detection. The reserved address helps to reduce allocation latency, and the optimistic DAD guarantees the uniqueness of addresses with smaller communication overhead. Through our simulation study, we show that AROD guarantees the uniqueness of allocated addresses and considerably improves allocation latency and communication overheads. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Karp2000,
	abstract = {We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the positions of routers and a packet's destination to make packet forwarding decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions using only information about a router's immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.},

In this paper we present an innovative design for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. The basic idea of the design is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other Mobile Hosts within the network. This amounts to a new sort of routing protocol. We have investigated modifications to the basic Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP [5], to make it suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is required by users wishing to utilize ad hoc networks. Our modifications address some of the previous objections to the use of Bellman-Ford, related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts. Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing can be modified to provide MAC-layer support for ad-hoc networks.},

In this paper we present Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), a novel algorithm for the operation of such ad-hoc networks. Each Mobile Host operates as a specialized router, and routes are obtained as needed (i.e., on-demand,) with little or no reliance on periodic advertisements. Our new routing algorithm is quite suitable for a dynamic self-starting network, as required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks. AODV provides loop-free routes even while repairing broken links. Because the protocol does not require global periodic routing advertisements, the demand on the overall bandwidth available to the mobile nodes is substantially less than in those protocols that do necessitate such advertisements. Nevertheless we can still maintain most of the advantages of basic distance-vector routing mechanisms. We show that our algorithm scales to large populations of mobile nodes wishing to form ad-hoc networks. We also include an evaluation methodology and simulation results to verify the operation of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {In a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), vehicles always move in high-speed which may cause the network topology changes frequently. This is challenging for routing protocols of VANET. Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) is a representative routing protocol of VANET. However, when constructs routing path, GPSR selects the next hop node which is very easily out of the communication range in greedy forwarding, and builds the path with redundancy in perimeter forwarding. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we proposed Maxduration-Minangle GPSR (MM-GPSR) routing protocol in this paper. In greedy forwarding of MM-GPSR, by defining cumulative communication duration to represent the stability of neighbor nodes, the neighbor node with the maximum cumulative communication duration will be selected as the next hop node. In perimeter forwarding of MM-GPSR when greedy forwarding fails, the concept of minimum angle is introduced as the criterion of the optimal next hop node. By taking the position of neighbor nodes into account and calculating angles formed between neighbors and the destination node, the neighbor node with minimum angle will be selected as the next hop node. By using NS-2 and VanetMobiSim, simulations demonstrate that compared with GPSR, MM-GPSR has obvious improvements in reducing the packet loss rate, decreasing the end-to-end delay and increasing the throughput, and is more suitable for VANET.},

	abstract = {In a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), high mobility and uneven distribution of vehicles are important factors affecting the performance of routing protocols. The high mobility may cause frequent changes of network topology, whereas the uneven distribution of vehicles may lead to routing failures due to network partition; even high density of vehicles may cause severe wireless channel contentions in an urban environment. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called the microtopology (MT), which consists of vehicles and wireless links among vehicles along a street as a basic component of routing paths and even the entire network topology. We abstract the MT model reflecting the dynamic routing-related characteristics in practical urban scenarios along streets, including the effect of mobility of vehicles, signal fading, wireless channel contention, and existing data traffic. We first analyze the endside-to-endside routing performance in an MT as a basis of routing decision. Then, we propose a novel street-centric routing protocol based on MT (SRPMT) along the streets for VANETs. Simulation results show that our proposed SRPMT protocol achieves higher data delivery rate and shorter average end-to-end delay compared with the performance of greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) and greedy traffic-aware routing (GyTAR).},

Recently, it was shown for the case of highway traffic that position-based routing approaches can very well deal with the high mobility of network nodes. However, baseline position-based routing has difficulties to handle two-dimensional scenarios with obstacles (buildings) and voids as it is the case for city scenarios. In this paper we analyze a position-based routing approach that makes use of the navigational systems of vehicles. By means of simulation we compare this approach with non-position-based ad hoc routing strategies (dynamic source routing and ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing). The simulation makes use of highly realistic vehicle movement patterns derived from Daimler-Chrysler's Videlio traffic simulator. While DSR's performance is limited due to problems with scalability and handling mobility, both AODV and the position-based approach show good performances with the position-based approach outperforming AODV.},

    doi = {10.5121/ijwmn.2011.3206},
    abstract = {In wireless ad hoc networks mobile stations or nodes are free to move around. The transmission range of the nodes is fixed in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) whereas the network topology changes in a different fashion. Due to dynamic nature of network topology some of the network links are destroyed while some new links are established. The routing protocols developed for wired networks cannot be used efficiently for wireless networks. For wireless ad hoc networks there are a few new routing protocols suitable for the dynamically changing ad hoc wireless environment. In this paper we compare the performance of two on-demand routing protocols (AODV and DSR) in terms of QoS parameters such as throughput, minimum, maximum \& average delay and packet delivery ratio. We performed extensive simulations using NS-2 simulator using both conventional TCP and TCP Vegas traffic sources. Keywords AODV, DSR, MANET routing protocols, TCP \& TCP Vegas.},

    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05905},
    doi = {10.1109/SaCoNeT.2018.8585453},
    abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are characterized by frequent routing path failures due to the high mobility caused by the sudden changes of the direction of vehicles. The routing paths between two different vehicles should be established with this challenge in mind. Stability and connectedness are a mandatory condition to ensure a robust and reliable data delivery. The idea behind this work is to exploit a new reactive routing technique to provide regulated and well-connected routing paths. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are referred to as drones can be both involved in the discovery process and be full members in these discovered paths in order to avoid possible disconnections on the ground when the network is sparsely connected. The different tests of this technique are performed based on NS-2 simulator and the outcomes are compared with those of related on-demand routing protocols dedicated for VANETs. Interesting results are distinguished showing a reduced end-to-end delay and a high delivery ratio, which proving that this heterogeneous communication between vehicles and UAVs is able to extend the network connectivity.},
